# FFmpeg-MCP
Using ffmpeg command line to achieve an mcp server, can be very convenient, through the dialogue to achieve the local video search, tailoring, stitching, playback and other functions

## Support Tools
The server implements the following tools: <br/>
- `find_video_path`
  The parameters are directory and file name, file name can be complete, or is not suffixed, recursive search in the directory, return the full path
- `get_video_info`
  The parameters are video path, return the video info, linkes duration/fps/codec/width/height.
- `clip_video`
  The parameter is the file path, start time, end time or duration, and returns the trimmed file path
- `concat_videos`
  The parameters are the list of files, the output path, and if the video elements in the list of files, such as width, height, frame rate, etc., are consistent, quick mode synthesis is automatically used
